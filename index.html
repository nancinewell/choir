            <p>We're so grateful to have you sing with us!</p>

            <p>"A ward choir can do a great deal to influence the spirituality of a meeting. When a choir performs appropriate music, the hearts of both the choir and congregation are touched as the Spirit of the Lord is invited into the meeting. But the benefits of a ward choir do not end there. During practices, choir members experience fellowship and unity as they sing together. Little wonder that disciples of Christ have long been encouraged to “make a joyful noise unto the Lord” and “come before his presence with singing” (Ps. 100:1, 2)."
